# Master-Thesis

#### In this thesis, I have provided a rigorous proof of the existence of the mean-field limit in the 1/2-spin quantum many-body system. 

#### To tackle the complexity of non-countable quantum spin systems, I devised a mathematical counting method that ingeniously transforms them into countable systems. This groundbreaking approach allows for feasible computations and facilitates the implementation of the counting method in quantum spin systems for the first time. 

#### It is worth to mention that this counting method has never been implemented into quantum spin systems before and I have implemented it successfully in this thesis.
